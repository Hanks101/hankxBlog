Gaia-Mother Earth

A Poem Written By : Haji Alusine Nyanda Kawah aka Hankx.

Dedicated to All Environmentalists And Marginalized Persons.

M other of everything that liveth
  producer of fresh air 
  that invigorates my weary soulz
O ceans level rising  
T reasures upon treasures are found - within the depths of Gaia!(Mother Earth)
H eaven ? I have not yet seen, 
 therefore for the time being
  Gaia is my humble abode
 I am Proud of my Earthly home
E arth's temprature rising - nearing that "fateful treshold" 
 environmental Sustainability, "environmental Sustainability- the recurring refrain of us :Millinials
R eserves of Mother Earth
 that mankind has unwittingly exploited for eons and Millinia !

E verywhere 
 I hear the Cries of Victims of Natural Disasters
A venging Hurricane, Chaotic El-Ninos,Famine ,Thawing Polar Ice-Caps
R eceding lakes,streams and watering holes !
T empest raging Incessantly ,all CONSEQUENCES of
H umankinds Unwise Consumerism!

Remeber dear global brethren, that ;
"We are from the Earth,
 We are of Mother Earth- therefore a Balance must be met
An Ultimate Equillibrium,
A "Blue and  Circular Economy"
For 'health' and 'Wellbeing' of Mother Earth is Premium!
