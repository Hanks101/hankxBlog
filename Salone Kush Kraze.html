 <hr>
 
 <p>  Substance Abuse amongst the youths in Sierra Leone is increasing at an alarming rate.
Despite of all its social ills and psychoSocial ill effects many youths don't seems to
 get enough of abusing drugs and psycho-active substances.</p>

<center><h3><span style="color:red;">Kush </span>the Youth's Doom</h3></center>
<br>
<hr>

<p>Kush was arguably was introduced in Sierra Leone in 2018-2019 <br>
is actually a mixture of sythetic chemicals,<br>
Concentrated THC tincture,terpennes,myrcene and <br>
some sources even claim that it is even laced with <br>
Formaldehyde( which is used to preserve dead tissue) <br>
- sprayed unto dried potpourri plant or tobacco<br>
 which acts as the base.</p>
 
<p>The word itself "kush" is a misnomer , <br>
and was originally used to refer to a more<br>
 potent strain/ variety of marijuana.<br>
But rather unfortunately this substance now being<br>
 abused by youths is not even organic marijuana but<br>
  an "artificial designer drug"-which consists of highly toxic<br>
   psychoactive chemicals sprayed unto a base.<br>
As soon as kush came into the scene ,PWUs ( People who use)<br>
 quickly nicknamed it   " Mad-World" as a reflection to the way<br>
  it renders users<br>
  in an altered state of reality- that is best described <br>
  as "near- madness";causing hallucinations,extraâ€“sensory feelings,<br> 
  panic attacks, <br>
  paranoia ,incoherent <br>
  and slurry speech  etc.</p>
  
  <hr>
<p><span style="color:red;">Kush</span> is 5 to 10 times as expensive and as potent as marijuana- <br>
which before now served as the main "gate-way drug" to <br>
addiction- with the average cost at le 5000.<br>
In a LDC - Less developed Country like Sierra Leone,<br>
with many persons earning less than $1.75 per day ie approximately le 10,000;<br>
 buy an illegal drug at such price is exorbitant and an<br>
  expensive bad habit.<br>
  Said habit is not only unsustainable but also renders users as socio-economic <br>
  misfits,who misplace their life's priorities and responsibilities <br>
  ,which in turn deters their personal wellbeing and no prospect <br>
  to Financial savings and reserve in case of a 'rainy day'.</p>

  <hr>

<p>Considering the snowball effect of drug-tolerance,regular users <br>
are rarely satisfied with just one "pack" of kush per day.<br>
According to findings of a research done by the author( Hankx),<br>
 many <span style="color:red;">kush</span> smokers use (or rather misuse) whatever money they have on them inorder<br>
  to chase the next high and feed the proverbial  ""monkey on their backs".<br>
  Many user testified to even soughting out loans from friends,family members<br>
   just to quench their unholy thirst of addiction.<br>
   What an Irony !</p>
   
   <hr>
<p>Again ironically after said "high" comes the  crashing
 feeling of paranoia,depression,loss of focus,low self-esteem and 
 self hate,guilt,and many a times anti-social behavior.
It is quite evident that this prevents any users from 
being productive and renders him or her lethargic 'couch-potatoes',
with little or no inclination to do any beneficial work.
Consequently leaving the addicted users to wallow 
in mediocrity and poverty.</p>

<hr>
<p>Getting caught with kush in <span style="color:green;">Sierra Leone </span>,<br>
needless to say is a crime  <br>
and carries a hefty fine that is usually <br>
coupled with incarceration.My advice to every bright<br> 
and promising youth in Mama Salone is to<br>
 " keep off from whatever form of drug/substance abuse,<br> 
 and stay focused on<br>
   activities that will help develop <br>
   oneself financially,intellectually and socially.<br>
   " It may sound so cliche' but tis True - <br>
   For together we can make <span style="color:green;">Mama Salone </span>Great again!<br>
   Peace and Love.<span style="color:lime;">Stay Safe </span>and<span style="color:blue;"> Stay Sane!</span><br>
 Hankx Out.</p>
