<center><h1>Why Code?</h1></center>
<hr>

<div>
Please note that the words , "Coding" and "programing", "software development " are used interchangeably<br> 
and refer to the same thing ,i.e "Computer programming".<br>
Thanks, enjoy reading!<br>

<h2>Reason 1 :</h2>
<h1>Improves Problem Solving Ability and Boosts Mental Resilience</h1></div>
<div>
<blockquote>Qoute : " A computer is a bicycle for your mind" - Steve Jobs (RIP)..." No Pain No Gain!"</blockquote>

<span style="font-family:cursive;">Hankx Qoute: </span><blockquote>"Coding Improves self-confidence and self discipline
 and overall self-esteem".- </blockquote>
So whenever you are feeling bored ,stressed ,sad :
<blockquote> "Just Code It !"</blockquote></div>
<hr>

<p>
The human brain just loves mental challenges, as also in the<br>
case of Body Building - when you dont use it ,you'll loose it".<br>
Do not allow your brain "muscles" to get atrophy! <br>
Because the brain loves to be bombarded with cognitive and <br>
other mental exercises ;these exercises help the <br>
brain to develop resilience as they condition the mind<br>
 to think in an objective and logical way.</p>

><h2>Reason 2: Boost Your Resume'</h2>
</center>
<hr>

<p>Having advanced ICT skills ,is a great boost to anyone's Resume' <br>
- irrespective of one's academic qualifications.<br>
Nowadays all modern offices are equipped with computers<br>
 and gadgets ; that require some "tech savvyness" inorder to operate .<br>
 Therefore knowing having ICT skills is a must ,but having the<br>
ability to code is a Big Plus !<br>
As you can find innovative ways to solve common problems <br>
and increase productivity - ( which in turn reduces cost and <br>
time wastage ,thereby allowing you to work smarter,faster Not harder !<br>
 </p>

<center>
<h2>Case Study 1(One) :</h2>
</center>

<p>I have a friend that studied Bsc. Environmental Management and Quality Control (EMQC) ,<br>
but also took an extra course  on Geographic Information Systems -Gis  using ArcGis Suite ,he<br>
 tried his best to get certified for it. 
 <nl>Fast-forward several years later ,after <br>
 graduation , it was'nt easy for him to find a job in his area of study i.e EMQC, <br>
 but fortunately he applied ( using his GIS Certificate) for a job offer at a new  <br>
 BioEnergy Company.And Viola, he was accepted as the GIS officer for that company.<br> 
Please note that ,he did get the job mainly due to his GIS Certificate.</p>

<span style="font-family:cursive;">Qoute - " The harder you work ,the Luckier you become !..." Believe What you want ,but people that PUT IN THE HARD WORK ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE luckier !<br></span>

<center><h2>Reason 3 :Coding Improves Productivity</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Case 2 : </h2>
<p>
Here at Hank WebMasters - a Subsidiary of Hankx Tech and Cyber Security Consultantcy ,<br>
we use an Automated Employee Register (AER) : that  uses facial recognition <br>
and artificial intelligence (AI) that automatically logs every team member's time of <br>
arrival,time of departure etc and its also flags  Absentees.<br>
Our AI systemrequires no human input once set up and cannot be <br>
falsified as in the case of a traditional log Book - manned by a secretary.<br>
Consequently this helps to keep our employees /team members<br>
minimal ,manageable and accountable, viz all hallmarks of a highly produvtive team.<br>
The Ai has been trained to observe and report any irregular attendance behavioral patterns.<br>
At Hankx Webmasters (HWM) We tty our best to uphold the principle of not<br>
 replicating duties and tasks - In order to increase FOCUS and prevent confusion and Chaos.<br>
Therefore we had to develop and deploy this AI tool by ourselves ,becaue the cost of similar Commercial Software Packages <br>
is Prohibitively And NEEDLESSLY expensive - therefore we created our own using <br>
our collective CODING SKILLS! Kinda Super kool and Geeky if you ask me...it was fun though !<br>

</p><h2> Reason 4 : Improves And Enables Creativity For Diyers <br>
And Electronics Hobbyists.</h2>
</center>

<center><h2>More Fun Projects ,For Nerds and Geeks.</h2></center>

<p>
Since I (Hankx) was young,I have always been passionate about <br>
innovation,creativity,repair <br>
,modify things -esp. eclectronics gadgets.<br>
At one time I wanted to make a Water  level detector <br>
for our water well.<br>
Like always I did some research and discovered that ; I'll need <br>
some sensors and  Microcontrollers(MCUs).<br>
But most importantly I should have some Computer Programming <br>
skills inorder to "talk" with and control the MCUs.<br>
This was one of the reasons why I started to Learn Coding.<br>
At that time I did notnhave a Personal computer .<br>
I had been given " Cpp for Dummies" by a friends father( Mr Solomon Villa ).<br>
Reader pls note that ,at that time I did not have a personal computer,therefore<br>
 I usually go to a cyber-cafe (year 2005 ) <br>
 called "FrontLine  Cafe @ Hannah Becker-Coker Street,Brookfields.
 </p>

<p>
I practiced mostly what is called "Dry Coding" - learning <br>
visualization and imagining stuff and abstract concepts!<br>
So much fun I had Reading " Cpp for Dummies.." and curled up in my<br>
 favorite armchair, with my book ,was my daily reverie/"escape-zone".<br>
Years later when I had a Pc on my own;<br>
I then realized that I had "playfully" mastered most Object Oriented Programming  (OOP) concepts<br> 
all by self ! ~ mind u many  University computer science students find<br>
 many of these High-level programming concepts hard to digest.<br>
 ( No Self flattery intended just the facts )</p>
 
<p>
I later applied my coding skills to control,programme <br>
Arduinos,Beagle Bones,and later on RaspBerry Pi for fun projects<br>
 ( These Mini Computer I had a loving relatves ordered and ship to Me! )<br>

<blockquote>hank Qoute: " " Fun" sometimes mean solving real life challenges". </blockquote><br>
 For example creating a Security Alarm System ... tracking livestock in rural areas<br>
 coding Just brings the Creativity  outta you So  "Just CodeIt !" <br>
</p>
<hr>

<center><h2> Reason 5 : Job Security And Diverse Income  Stream</h2></center><br>

<center><blockquote>Qoute : "Adapt or Die" Anon</blockquote></center><br>

<p>
When you look at how rapidly the world is changing and developing <br>
techological- wise ;<br>
After the Covid -19 pandemic hit,many 'traditional' jobs were lost<br>
,but those of the software developer,Web developer ,<br>
 graphic designers and Cybersec was Secured and actually  <br>
 demand increased for IcT professionals, since there is hardly any<br>
  aspect of human life that does not depend on computers nowadays.<br>
  </p>

<p>
Consequently also more jobs were available online and remote work is now trending.<br>
As conventional jobs are being phased out gradually but surely by machines,<br>
robots and Artificial intelligence - Knowing how to code will surely keep you<br>
 abreast with this rapid global change!<br>
 </p>

<p>
 is as secured as " Donald Trump's tax returns statement- <br
 pun intended! Also the annual salaries of developers is way higher <br>
  than that of  most fields ,some developers<br>
 even have a more flexible option of working Remote ,<br>
part-time and multiple jobs simultaneaosly.<br>
At Hankx Tech we are currently developing<br>
 BlockcChain Trading Platform for LDCs -least developed <br>
countries ie the global "south" if  you like.<br>
We are now planning to launch our
 pilot project in Sierra Leone soonest.</p>

<blockquote>Hankx Qoute: " Dont be a Ludite- embrace technological Changes!  "</blockquote><br>

<hr>
<center><h2> Reason 6 : Diversify Income Stream And Reduce Vulnerability Context </h2></center>
<hr>
<p>
It is nice to be specialized  in any given field <br>
,but also being good or better in another unrelated field <br>
 or area of study other than the one you got  certified <br>
  for in University is always a "win-win" ,<br>
  this is where knowing how to Code comes in handy.</p>
  
<p>We all have seen many  graduates and post graduates emmigrating to more<br>
 developed countries only to find out that their 'expensive' academic <br>
  Certificates are not in demand in these job markets.</p>
  
<p>
 But knowing how to code will can be a great equallizer,<br>
 just take look at many tech Super rich.<br>
So therefore whenever you find yourself thinking that programming is difficult <br>
-try to motivate yourself with the thought of early retirement,self-employment<br>
( having no irritating Boss ..lolz)Just Liesure ...<br>
 Then Get Your 'Hands Dirty' and<br>
 " JUSTCodeIt!."

<center><h2> <em>Reason 7</em>: An Alternative for Scientists,Data Analysts -<br>
Who Can't Afford Propriety / Not- For-Sale Software</h2></center>

<hr>
<blockquote><span style="font-family:cursive;"><em>hankx Qoute:</em> </span>" Coding truely gives one "God-like" Powers!"</blockquote>

<h3>Case 3 :</h3>

<p>
 Here at Hankx Tech, Hankx (myself) and a team-member <br>
 (I don't like to use the term "employee") applied <br>
 our Coding skills to develop a user friendly <br>
 Graphical User Interface,Custom Scripts that<br>
  automate report etc for GrassGis <br>
  - Which is an open-source software that comes a python<br>
   console,;<br>
    when we did not want to pay for the <br>
   needlessly expensive ArcGis Suite.</p>
   
   
<p>
Consequently we we ingeniusly used our Coding Skills <br>
to Modify and customize GrassGIS UX/UI <br>
-user interface/experience to become more intuitive by "tweaking" <br>
 its GUI, creating custom scripts that will automate <br>
 periodic reporting logs with no external input! <br>
 Note that we now use  GrassGis extensively for surveys and<br>
  spatial planning ,Data visualization and simulation!<br>
  </p>
<p>
Also in our start-up we love to utilize Matplotlib,Numpy,SciKit <br>
(all open source programs) for data analysis and <br>
visualization instead of Commercial Packages like SPSS or Excell,<br>
just for the heck of it.<br>
</p>


<hr>
<center><h2>Reason 8: Automating  The Boring Tasks with Scripts-<br>
 Improving speed and Productivity</h2>
 
 <hr>

<span style="font-family:cursive;"><blockquote>Qoute: "Even a monkey can write a shakespare given enough time! Anonymous</blockquote></span>

<p>
You can automate repetitive daily tasks using scripts,<br>
thus free some time for more important stuff.<br>
Scripts can be written with Python,Bash,Powershell,Batch VBscripts etc.<br>
Scripting is relatively easy as compared to learning a <br>
fully fledge programming language.<br>
Scripting is also less CPU -intensive due to the fact that <br>
they are interpreted and not compiled.<br>
Scripts can also be run directly from a browser window eg Javascript,Pyscripts etc.<br>
You can even run scripts directly on your smart phone!<br>
