I am Mansa Bakarri
I am Mansa Bakarri
I am Mansa Bakarri
I walk through the Path Of Darkness seeking the Light
As the Sun shine above
So does it shine below
As the Moon flaunts her silvery beams of beauty
So as the dirt of the grave is cold

I am Mansa Bakarri
I am Mansa Bakarri
I am Mansa Bakarri
Of Sagas and legends Untold
I am the sumation of all my ancestors, that walked the noble path before me.
I am the sumation of all my Posterity that will walk this noble path after Me.
As ancient as the foundations of the Earth I be
But yet as young and tender as the Spring Sappling
I AM

I Am Light
I am a "bearer of the ancient torch of Life"
Abiding in me is the Spark of the Ka' of the Great Spirit
For I am in all there is
But I am "none like you have ever seen"
I am Merciful,
Giver of Life and Respite
I am Death to all the enemies of my kinsmen
- The Sacred Serpent- "Hapath"
that spits "fire" into the eyes of the foes of my Kin

I am the "Great One" 
Like the Great gods beyond the Northern Rapids
I am like Ngewoh,
I am like Ra
And also a proud son of my Pa
Tis and very much more;
I AM

Yet I am a humble Pilgrim
In this life and the next
Oh Kindred Spirits - from a parallel Dimension !
Hear the plea of my Sacred Breath
For despite being Mortal
I posseds the Soul of the Sun 
That is my Ka'
For I Am
