Poem No: 5


Oh! What pitiful sight to behold , Polar bears on melting icebergs
Disappearing floes!
All due to the unwise Consumerism of Gaia's prime foe -
Humankind.
Tragedy Upon Irony
Man's actions and inactions - the cause of our present Woes
Yet still we go on with the flow !
BLAH! BLAH! BLAH!


Young Bellies growling -like thunder
Sub-Saharan Africa's food Scarcity,
meagre harvest with inaccessibility!
The Causes to "Our" constant hunger
Starvation and spells of  Droughts
Biodiversity Loss And Habitat Degradation
In the 'East-Horn ' of Africa
Here and There - in the "Global South"
The mainstay of Famine and Starvation
Poverty is Trife
Grazing Lands and Farm lands Conflict and Strife
Morbid Smells of Death and Decay - of once plump livestocks
Yet Amidst all this Fray
Curable infectious diseases and "Brain-Drain"
The feeling of prolonged loss hangs in the air
Transnational Industries churning out toxic fumes ,Polluting Mother Earth's Once Pristine athmosphere
Deforestation and indiscriminate logging of the "Lungs of Gaia"
(Amazon Forest)
Loss Of indigenious heritage as if No one Cares!
And Yet All our policy makers are specialized in is  :
BLAH! BLAH! BLAH!



"Watch out for the advancing Dessert ! " 
Compatriots of the Sahel-Belt 
In Agroforestry and Bioremediaton engage!
Inorder for the dangers of the "Crawling" sand dunes to Avert
Work in-tandem with Environmental Experts
Do not Model after the Institutional adherents of:
BLAH!  BLAH!  BLAH!



Oh Youths ,let Our Livelihood activities be Diverse
Our Sacres Ancestral Groves ,Virgin rainforests - Conserve!
Let Our natural 'treasures': gold,diamonds,Rutile and Marine life... -be Reserved !
For if the  " Fragile Tresh-Hold" is Perversed ;
Even if the whole Universe, We travese
Humankind's imminent Doom could not be Reversed!
Let the Noble Cause of Sustainable Development be globally Dispersed
Oh ! how I  Detest their Jargons and empty words:
Blah! Blah!  BLAH!

Majestic and Beautiful Marine fauna and flora
We Kill
Oil Spill ! Oil Spill! Oil Spill!
Any Yet Still 
In the " Deep-Blue" -for "Black-Gold" ,they Drill!
Wetlands, Marshes and Creeks,
How I Pity The Poor Birds - "a Safe Breeding grounds they seek!""
Global Species loss,and  Widespread threat of Extinction,
And Yet Still,All I can Hear is their Actionless  Din :
Blah! Blah ! Blah !



In act of destroying  Gaia - Mankind has 'Aced'
Nuclear Arms Race 
Now all I hear is,"Trip  to Mars" Race!
Trillions 'wasted' - whilst countless millions  to  death Starve!
What a Shame!
No Pure water for the multitude ,Nor the Famished Livestock  Herds
Hyper inflated Development Indicators - 
Grossly Misleading and Distorting 
The Poor People's REALITY!
Over Hyped Development Statistics
Such Unbearable "Clamour and Din"
Unbearable UnHoly Bureaucratic - 
Blah! Blah ! Blah!




Like Unwary Civilizations of Old - now "gone with the wind.."
Tis a Similar path HumanKind is Heading Indeed
Micro-plastics - found in our guts and spleens
Due to Toxic Fumes - "Oh! My  I just can't breathe!"
Mother Earth :Once a Green and lush Garden
A Majestic garden - fit for a King !
Now only filled with "Scavengers" and Debris
-Benefiting from the deaths of their own Kin
With Corruption that is Systemic 
Like the Global Pandemic !
"Lukewarm " Governments ,MDA's,NGOs,INGOs and Charities
Only proficient at ' dark' deeds : 
Public funds Embezzelling 
Social-Media Flexing 
Gibberish blabbering
And like ' Napoleon' -the pig (of AnimaL Farm Fame)
Irritatingly SQUEALING
Blah ! Blah ! Blah !

 I say Kudos! Kudos! Kudos! 
 Strive On! Strive On! Strive On!
"Warriors" for Mother  Earth
To :Miss Gretta Thunberg ,the "Green Belt Initiative", 
Melinda and Gates Foundation
Every Advocates of the Blue-Circular Economy
Human-Rights Activists, Educators,Researchers
Philantropists
To "all and sundry" 
KINDRED SPIRITS! STRIVE ON!
Exemplified By Vigilant Actions
Non-conformists to the Systemic Syndrome of
 " Blah ! Blah! Blah!"


Inorder to Save Our Dear Mother Earth 
A Radical Global Action is needed
NOW! NOW ! NOW!
But Alas ! 
All we - the MILLINIALS hear is a guttural monotonous 
BLAH ! BLAH!  BLAH!
